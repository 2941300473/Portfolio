    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p2 style= "font-family: Open sans;">
 I was born in Hawaii but later moved to California for three years because of my fathers job. During that time I discovered I had a passion for playing video games and has been my go to hobby ever since then. Other things I also enjoy are reading, drawing, and writing in my free time.
